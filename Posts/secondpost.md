## Internationalization

Internationalization is the process of designing and developing your software or mobile application product so it can be adapted and localized to different cultures, regions, and languages.

Internationalization helps you build your software or mobile application product with future markets and languages in mind. It’s the process of neutralizing the code, content, and design so that, down the road, it’ll be easier to adapt your product to additional cultures without having to completely re-engineer it.

Internationalization ensures your software is localizable and is typically done by software developers and engineers.

Even if your initial product design and launch is a source or native language of English, internationalization allows you to ensure it could support other languages and cultures if you were to expand to additional markets in the future.
