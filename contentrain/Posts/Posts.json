It’s the process of neutralizing the code, content, and design so that, down the road, it’ll be easier to adapt your product to additional cultures without having to completely re-engineer it.\n\nInternationalization ensures your software is localizable and is typically done by software developers and engineers.\n\nEven if your initial product design and launch is a source or native language of English, internationalization allows you to ensure it could support other languages and cultures if you were to expand to additional markets in the future.\n\n**Source** : [https://lokalise.com/blog/internationalization-vs-localization/](https://lokalise.com/blog/internationalization-vs-localization/)\n",
